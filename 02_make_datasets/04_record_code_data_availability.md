# 4. Record Code and Data Availability

For each included paper entry in `included_papers.csv`, skim the paper again and record the following information in the relevant columns (1 if true, 0 if False):

1. Does all required data appear to be shared/available? (`All_Data` column)
2. Does all code appear to be available? (`All_Code`)
3. If (2) is not true, is some code available? (`Partial_Code`)
4. If code/data are available, where are they stored? Options include: `Appendix`, `Dryad`, `Zenodo`, `Figshare`, `OSF`, a n organization-specific database (`Org_Database`), `Github`, some other database like GBIF (`Other_Database`), or in another paper (`Other_Paper`).
5. Do there appear to be any missing appendices that the text claim exist? (`Missing_Appendix`)
6. Is a link to data/code (if the paper claims it exists) missing or broken? (`Missing_Broken_Link`)
7. Are some components of the data or code the paper implies exist apparently missing? (`Missing_Components`)
8. Is a link to a database provided, but without enough specific information to get the paper's dataset or code? (`Database_Not_Enough_Info`)
9. Is only BUGS/Stan model code provided rather than complete R code to run the model? (`Model_Code_Only`)
10. Other notes (`Notes`)
