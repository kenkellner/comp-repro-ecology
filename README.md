# How functional and reproducible is code shared by ecology papers?

Public archival of analysis code and associated data is increasingly required or encouraged by scientific journals upon paper acceptance.
Making both data and code available has numerous reported benefits, including increased transparency of methods, facilitation of future studies, and enabling complete reproduction of a paper's results.
At present, however, there are few standards or checks on publicly available code, and in our experience it is rarely examined by reviewers.
This leads to three questions: (1) how common is code sharing in recent papers; (2) how functional is the code, and (3) how reproducible are analyses when both code and data area publicly available?
This study attempts to answer these three questions for recent papers on species distribution and abundance.
