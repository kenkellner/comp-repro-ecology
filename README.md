# Reproducibility of hierarchical modeling analyses in ecology

Sharing both code and data is increasingly a requirement of publishing ecological research.
However, there is rarely any significant review of either published code or data.
This study will run code from published papers that use hierarchical models to estimate species distribution and abundance, to estimate the degree to which the analyses are reproducible.
